### 5. Source Engine–Specific Terms

*   **5.1.** Compiled or packed versions of the Content for the Source engine (e.g., MDL, VTX, VVD, PHY, QC outputs, packed materials) are Derived Works and remain subject to this License; they may not be Distributed.
*   **5.2.** Use of the Content or Derived Works on any public or shared Source engine server, or any server where clients, players, or third parties can obtain or experience the assets, is prohibited without the Licensor’s prior written permission.
*   **5.3.** This License does not grant any rights under Valve’s or any third-party terms. You must independently comply with all applicable third-party licenses and EULAs. Nothing herein waives or supersedes those terms.

### 6. Platform and Caching

*   **6.1.** Ephemeral, automatic caching by the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) solely for the purpose of displaying or delivering the Repository to you does not grant you any rights beyond those stated herein.
*   **6.2.** You may not rely on platform features (such as forking, mirroring, or public cloning) to justify Redistribution. If platform functionality permits copying, that does not constitute permission under this License.

### 7. Permission Requests

*   **7.1.** Any use not expressly permitted by this License requires the Licensor’s prior express written consent.
*   **7.2.** To request permission, contact the Licensor using the channels identified in the Repository or Licensor profile. Permission may be granted or denied at the Licensor’s sole discretion and may be conditioned on additional terms.

### 8. DMCA and Enforcement

*   **8.1.** Unauthorized use, Distribution, or Commercial Use of the Content or any Derived Work will result in enforcement actions, which may include DMCA takedown notices, cease-and-desist demands, account or hosting reports, and legal action.
*   **8.2.** You agree that monetary damages may be inadequate to remedy a breach and that the Licensor shall be entitled to injunctive or equitable relief without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages.

### 9. Term and Termination

*   **9.1.** This License is effective upon your first access to the Content and continues until terminated.
*   **9.2.** This License automatically terminates without notice if you breach any term. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Content and Derived Works and permanently delete all copies in your possession or control (including backups and compiled outputs).
*   **9.3.** The Licensor may, at their discretion, reinstate the License in writing upon cure of a breach; reinstatement may be conditioned and is not guaranteed.

### 10. No Warranty

THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. YOUR USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

### 11. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR ENHANCED DAMAGES; LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS; OR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE CONTENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ALL CASES, THE LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE U.S. DOLLAR (USD $1).

### 12. Indemnification

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Licensor from and against any and all claims, actions, proceedings, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or related to your use of the Content or any Derived Work, your breach of this License, or your violation of any law or third-party rights.

### 13. Miscellaneous

*   **13.1. Acceptance.** You agree that downloading, cloning, copying, accessing, or using the Content constitutes acceptance of this License.
*   **13.2. Entire Agreement.** This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Licensor with respect to the Content and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding the Content.
*   **13.3. Amendments.** The Licensor may update this License for future releases of the Content. Such updates will not retroactively grant rights where a breach has already occurred. Your continued use after an update is posted indicates acceptance of the updated terms for the updated Content.
*   **13.4. No Waiver.** No failure or delay by the Licensor to exercise any right or remedy under this License shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right or remedy.
*   **13.5. Severability.** If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
*   **13.6. Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer this License or any rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Licensor’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing is void.
